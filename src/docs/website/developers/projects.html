This is the PETSc to-do list; any help on these would be greatly
appreciated. Each of the first few projects could be done by a graduate
student or advanced undergraduate in a couple of months.<br>

          <h3>Daniel Szyld suggests a refined way of computing overlap
for additive Schwarz. Instead of taking all rows/columns connected to
the block take those with "strong" coupling.&nbsp; I think this could
be easily added to PETSc. <br>

tridiagonal) and write fast sequential solvers for them. Also do fast
parallel tridiagonal solvers.</li>

        <li>The MatCreateSeqCUFFT() and MatCreateSeqFFTW() should be
both made subclasses of an abstract Mat class for FFTs. Allowing
command line switching between them etc so that user code makes no
mention of the particular FFT package being used.<br>

      </ul>
&nbsp; Below is a bunch of random ideas of things that need to be done.<br>
      <br>
Rewrite BlasLapack.py to handle --download-f-blas-lapack
with seperate package file and cleanup like
totally<br>
      <br>
Rewrite MPI.py to handle the --download-mpich --download-openmpi as
seperate package files and cleanup like totally.<br>
      <br>
Make a new matrix type MPIMSBAIJ that works like MPISBAIJ but stores
the off -diagonal portions twice (like AIJ). This would have better
load balance for work and storage.<br>
      <br>
Change the numbering of vector elements for DA ordering to run over the
z then y then x &nbsp;rather than the current x, then y, then z. This
is to match the way the MPI &nbsp;cartesian communicator orders things.
See petsc-users mail from Sean Dettrick. Should not change the user
interface.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Fix all MatPartitioners to optionally turn on edge weights from
the matrix values. Currently the are ignored for all partitioners
except parmetis, where they are incorrectly always used.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Provide support for shared libraries with gcc on cygwin: &nbsp;<a
 href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/dll.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/dll.html</a><br>
      <br>

When solving F(x) = 0, I would like to be able to scale both the
solution<br>
vector x and the residual function vector F, simply by specifying
scaling<br>
vectors, sx and sf, say. (These vectors would be the diagonal entries of<br>
scaling matrices Dx and Df.)<br>
I realize this can be achieved, at least in part, within the user
residual<br>
function.<br>
This is what I had been doing, until I looked at Denis and Schnabel
(sp?),<br>
Brown and Saad, and the KINSOL user guide. It seems one has to take the<br>
scaling matrices into account when computing various norms, when
applying the<br>
preconditioner, and when computing the step size, \sigma. No doubt there<br>
are other things I have missed that also need to be done.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Make PetscBagLoad() machine independent by requiring the user to
register the<br>
entire bag before calling PetscBagLoad()<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; add GMRESR<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Add PCCreate_LRC() see MatCreateLRC()<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; (Priority 1) Add DAVecGetArrayf90() Hmmm, thought I did this a
long time ago?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Priority 1) Add new KSP that allows reordering unknowns
(parallel or sequential) for better performance and then calls regular
KSP. Or should this be PC?<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Priority 2) General mechanism for DMGetMatrix() etc
...for composite matrices<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Make all KSP (if possible) use either preconditioned or
unpreconditioned norms for monitoring &amp; convergence (e.g. BCGSL)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; I like the idea of having an optional usage logging facility in
PetscInitialize() and PetscFinalize().&nbsp; A mysql database on a
server somewhere sounds good. Kind of like how we use FLEXLM for
licensed software. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;* this could be used to log -log_summary, -snes_view etc
results.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Fix GMRES and SYMMLQ so that if they detect happy breakdown the
proper cleanup is done and the converged reason is set to
KSP_CONVERGED_HAPPY_BREAKDOWN. Currently it is done in ad hoc ways.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make LSQR properly handle nonzero initial guess by
simply computing the residual right hand side; solving that and then
adding back the initial guess.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add support for point block diagonal scaling the
matrix before calling KSPSolve.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; An almost linear time LU solver for second order elliptic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; operators
(http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~bebendorf/AHMED.html)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another software library on Hierarchical Matrices for
Elliptic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Differential equations (AHMED)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; An approximate LU decomposition can be computed in the
algebra of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; hierarchical matrices with almost linear time complexity
and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the same robustness as the classical LU decomposition
method.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (http://hal.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/dune)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DUNE aims to reach the following goals:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Distributed development<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Unified access to different grid managers (ALBERTA
, UG),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visualization tools (Grape), solvers,
etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - high level abstraction through Operator concept<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ILUPACK www.math.tu-berlin.de/ilupack<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;QHULL<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;OpenDX<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>&nbsp; add support to lgrind to map char string tokens
with htmlmap.
Cannot do it before applying lgrind cause it cannot parse tex. Cannot
do it after lgrind because maplatexnames.py cannot&nbsp; handle the
yucky latex lgrind generates. Should be easy cannibalizing stuff from
Bill's sowing.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; keywords in maual pages should get listed in help topic list<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; need python tool to find all manual page functions that are
missing in the users manual.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Add troubleshooting entries and error messages with web
address for common errors.<br>
