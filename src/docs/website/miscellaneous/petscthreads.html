            With the advent of multi-core machines as standard practise
            on laptops to supercomputers the issue of a hybrid
            MPI-thread (MPI-OpenMP) "version" of PETSc is of interest.
            In this model there is one MPI process per CPU (node) and
            several threads on that CPU (node) working together inside
            that MPI process. Many people throw around the term "hybrid
            MPI-OpenMP as if it is a trivial change in the programming
            model; it is not, it has major ramifications that must be
            understood if it is to be used successfully. It can be done
            in many ways that affect its usability and performance. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
              simplest model of PETSc with threads</span> is to contain
            all the thread operations <span style="font-weight: bold;
              text-decoration: underline;">inside</span> the Mat and Vec
            classes leaving the users programming model identical to
            what it is today. This can be done in two ways by having a
            Vec and Mat class implementation that use<br>
            <ol>
              <li>OpenMP compiler directives to parallelize some of the
                methods</li>
              <li>POSIX threads (pthread) calls to parallelize some of
                the methods. </li>
            </ol>
            In petsc-3.2 we have implemented 2. the classes are
            VECSEQPTHREAD and MATSEQAIJPTHREAD they are very preliminary
            but can be played with. We hope to obtain from some elses
            implementations of 1. The user is free to also use threads
            for OpenMP in their code so long as that code does not make
            PETSc calls. See <a
                href="../features/threads.html">threads</a>
              for how to use the thread-based Vec and Mat.</p> <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A
              more complicated model of PETSc with threads</span> would
            allow users to write threaded code that made PETSc calls,
            this is not supported because PETSc
            <p align="left">is not currently thread-safe; because the
              issues involved with toolkits and thread safety is
              complex, this short answer is almost meaningless. Thus,
              this page attempts to explain how threads and thread
              safety relate to PETSc. Note that we are only discussing
              here "software threads" as opposed to "hardware threads" </p>
            <p align="left">Threads are used in 2 main ways</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p align="left"><small><font face="7x13"><font
                        color="#FF0000">loop level compiler control. </font>The
                      C/C++/FORTRAN compiler manages the dispatching of
                      threads at the beginning of a loop, where each
                      thread is assigned non-overlap selections from the
                      loop. OpenMP, for example, defines standards
                      (compiler directives) for indicating to compilers
                      how they should "thread parallelize" loops</font></small></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="left"><font face="7x13"><small><font
                        color="#FF0000">user control.</font> The
                      programmer manages the dispatching of threads
                      directly by assigning threads to tasks (eg. a
                      subroutine call). For example POSIX threads
                      (pthreads) or the user thread management in
                      OpenMP.</small></font></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Threads are merely streams of control and do not have any
              global data associated with them. Any global variables
              (e.g., common blocks in FORTRAN) are "shared" by all the
              threads, that is, any thread can access and change that
              data. In addition, any space allocated (e.g., in C with
              malloc or C++ with new) that a thread has a reference to
              can be read/changed by that thread. The only private data
              a thread has are the local variables in the subroutines
              that it has called (i.e., the stack for that thread) or
              local variables that you explicitly indicate are to be not
              shared in compiler directives. </p>
            <p>In its simplest form, thread safety means that any memory
              (global or allocated) that more than one thread has access
              to, has some mechanism to insure that it remains
              consistent when the various threads act upon it. This can
              be managed by simply associating a lock with each "memory"
              and making sure that each thread locks the memory before
              accessing it and unlocks when it has completed accessing
              the memory. In an object oriented library, rather than
              associating locks with individual data items, one can
              think about associating locks with objects; so that only a
              single thread can operate on an object at a time.</p>
            <p>PETSc is not thread-safe for three reasons: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>a few miscellaneous global variables - these may be
                fixed in later PETSc releases and are not a big deal</li>
              <li>a variety of global data structures that are used for
                profiling and error handling. These are not easily
                removed or modified to make thread-safe. The reason is
                that simply putting locks around all of these data
                accesses would have a major impact on performance since
                the profiling data structures are being constantly
                updated by the running code. In some cases, for example
                updating the flop counters, locks could be avoid and
                something like atomic fetch and add operations could be
                used. It is possible to build such operations on all
                major systems, often using special two-step memory
                operations (e.g., load-link and store-conditional on
                MIPS; load-reservation on PowerXX). But you can't do
                this in a portable, high-performance way, since it isn't
                part of C and there is no standardization on issuing asm
                code from within C source.</li>
              <li>all the PETSc objects created during a simulation do
                not have locks associated with them. Again, the reason
                is performance, having to always lock an object before
                using it, and then unlocking it at the end would have a
                large impact on performance. Even with very inexpensive
                locks, there will still likely be a few "hot-spots" that
                kill performance, for example if four threads share a
                matrix and are each calling MatSetValues(), this will be
                a bottleneck with those threads constantly fighting over
                the data structure inside the matrix object. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>PETSc can be used in a limited way that is thread safe,
              so long as only one of the threads calls methods on
              objects, or calls profiled PETSc routines, PETSc will run
              fine. For example, one could use loop level parallelism to
              evaluate a finite difference stencil on a grid, this is
              supported through the PETSc routines VecCreateShared(),
              see src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex5s.c. However, this is
              limited power. </p>
            <p><font color="#FF0000">Some concerns about a thread model
                for parallelism</font>. A thread model for parallelism
              of numerical methods appears to be powerful for problems
              that can store their data in very simple (well controlled)
              data structures. For example, if field data is stored in a
              two dimensional array, then each thread can be assigned a
              nonoverlapping slice of data to operate on. OpenMP makes
              managing much of this sort of thing reasonably
              straightforward.</p>
            <p>When data must be stored in a more complicated opaque
              data structure (for example an unstructured grid or sparse
              matrix), it is more difficult to partition the data among
              the threads to prevent conflict and still get good
              performance. More difficult, but certainly not impossible.
              For these situations, perhaps it is more natural for each
              thread to maintain its own private data structure that is
              later merged into a common data structure; but to do this
              one has to introduce a great deal of private state
              associated with the thread,&nbsp; i.e., it becomes more
              like a&nbsp; "light-weight process". </p>
            <p>In conclusion, at least for the PETSc package, the
              concept of being thread-safe is not simple. It has major
              ramifications about its performance and how it would be
              used; it is not a simple matter of throwing a few locks
              around and then every thing is honky-dory.</p>
