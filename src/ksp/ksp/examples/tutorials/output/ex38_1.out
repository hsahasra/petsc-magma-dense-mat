Initialization stage
Residual norm of starting guess: 7.120535
Residual norm of relaxation after 0.0001 20 relaxations: 0.016546 7.12054
Initialization stage: creating level 2
Level 2 can be treated directly.
Algorithm will use 2 levels.
After 1 iterations residual norm is 0.001217

After 3 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.043182
After 4 iterations residual norm is 0.000000
After 4 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.039107
General setup stage
Adding candidate vector 2
After 5 iterations residual norm is 0.000105
After 5 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.028312
After 6 iterations residual norm is 0.000000
After 6 iterations Rayleigh quotient of residual is 0.025977
General setup stage
nd_fast is true
either too many candidates for storage or cycle is already effective
