For Dof = 3, the number of stpoints needed is given by 2*dof-1 = 5

a b c . . .
d a b . . .
e d a . . .
. . . a b c
. . . d a b
. . . e d a

Elements marked as 'a' goes into stpoint k = 0, 'b' goes into k = 1, 'd' goes into k = 2, etc.
Displacements corresponding to these (in-dof) neighbors occur only in x-dimension.
