        type: gmres
          GMRES: restart=30, using Classical (unmodified) Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization with no iterative refinement
          GMRES: happy breakdown tolerance 1e-30
        maximum iterations=1
        tolerances:  relative=1e-05, absolute=1e-50, divergence=10000
        left preconditioning
        using nonzero initial guess
        using PRECONDITIONED norm type for convergence test
      PC Object:      (mg_levels_3_)       1 MPI processes      
        type: sor
          SOR: type = local_symmetric, iterations = 1, local iterations = 1, omega = 1
        linear system matrix = precond matrix:
        Matrix Object:         1 MPI processes        
          type: seqaij
          rows=625, cols=625
          total: nonzeros=3025, allocated nonzeros=3025
          total number of mallocs used during MatSetValues calls =0
            not using I-node routines
    Up solver (post-smoother) same as down solver (pre-smoother)
